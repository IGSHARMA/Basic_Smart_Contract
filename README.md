#Basic Smart Contract
This repository contains a simple smart contract designed for educational purposes. The smart contract has been deployed on the Sapolia Ethereum TestNet to explore and understand the mechanics of Ethereum transactions.

#Overview
The primary objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Ethereum smart contracts. By deploying to the Sapolia TestNet, the project provided practical insights into how Ethereum transactions are executed and how smart contracts operate within a blockchain environment.

#Deployment
The smart contract was deployed on the Sapolia TestNet, an environment that simulates Ethereum's main network. This allowed for real-time interaction with the contract without the need for real cryptocurrency, making it an ideal learning platform.

#Learning Objectives
Understanding the deployment process of smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
Gaining insights into the transactional flow and the execution of contracts on a TestNet.
Experimenting with Ethereum's capabilities in a risk-free environment.
This project is purely educational and serves as a basic introduction to the world of Ethereum smart contracts.
